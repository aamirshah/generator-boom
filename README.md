Usage
---

**BrowserSync** 

On the terminal just type `gulp bs`. It will automatically open a new tab in the browser. Copy the URL to other devices. Thats it !


**Production Build**

In order to generate the production code for deployment use `$ gulp --type production` or in case you are too lazy then type `$ gulp prod`.
